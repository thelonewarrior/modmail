# Mod Mail for Discord
This is an open source discord bot made by kyb3r and improved upon suggestions by the users! This is not the original build, this is a fork

## Hosting on Heroku
### What is Heroku?
Heroku is a free hosting site that can host many web apps. However, the web apps cannot store any data.    
We have made Mod Mail to do exactly that. It was made to be *stateless* and not store any data in json files or any other storage files.

### How do I do it? 
If you choose to install the bot using Heroku, you do not need to download anything. In fact, you can set it all up on a phone!    

### Heroku Account

You need to make a Heroku account. Make one at [Heroku's Website](https://heroku.com/) and then follow the steps below: 

### Setting it up

1. Create a Bot Application for Discord
2. Head over to the [applicatons page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
3. Click “new application”. Give it a name, picture and description.
4. Click “Create Bot User” and click “Yes, Do It!” when the dialog pops up.
5. Copy down the bot token. This is what is used to login to your bot and will be used at Step 8, or 11 if you are setting up on your PC.

6. Click this button: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)
7. Input some random name for your app, the heroku app name is not important.
8. Input your bot token from step 5 into the `TOKEN` field.
7. Put the [ID of your Server](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) into the `GUILD_ID` field.
10. Put the command prefix you want in the `PREFIX` field. e.g `?` The default prefix is `m.`
11. Click the `deploy app` button and wait for it to finish.
12. Click `manage app` and go into the `resources` tab. 
13. Now turn on the worker by clicking the pencil icon.
14. If you want, you can go over and check the application logs to see if everything is running smoothly.
15. Once the bot is online in your server, do `[your prefix]setup` and you are good to go!    
You can add the bot to your server with [this tool](https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0). Your Client ID is retrived from the [applicatons page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

Now you should be done. Go over to discord and try it out!

Make sure to give the bot manage channel permissions!
